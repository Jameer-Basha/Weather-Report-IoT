# Weather-Report-IoT

**Sensors Used:**

1. BMP180
2. DHT11
3. LDR

Weather Report Using IoT technology. 
The system aims to provide a real-time weather updates for a specific location.
It including temperature, humidy, pressure, altitude, and cloudiness. 
To achive this, we employ the DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity. 
While BMP180 sesnosr is utilized to gather data on pressure and altitude. 
The ESP32 microcontroller is utilized to connect the system to the internet, and we make use of Thingsboard to display the weather information. 
Additionally, we integrate the system with Twilio to enable users to receive weather updates via Whatsapp. 
Users can simply send a message to a designated number to obtained the weather details
